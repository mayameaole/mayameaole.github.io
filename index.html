       My name is Maya Meaole and I'm a second year Public Policy at the University of California, Riverside. I was born and raised in San Diego but moved to Grand Terrace in 2014, after about 2 years I moved to Highland, California, which is where I currently reside. Studying Policy has always been something I have been interested in, but I was mostly interested in Public Policy for the intersectionality of it. Having the option to go into Government, Public Health, Non-Profits, and things of the sort is what excites me the most about this field. Public Policy allows me to explore a variety of sectors while working toward meaningful change, which aligns with my passion for social justice, advocacy, and community development. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am deeply involved in campus life. I work at the Office of Asian Pacific Student Programs as a Student Program Coordinator, where I help organize events that celebrate and uplift the diverse cultures within the Asian and Pacific Islander communities. One of the biggest events Iâ€™ve helped coordinate is the Fall Welcome, which brings students together to foster connections and provide resources for their success. Additionally, I am actively engaged in the Pacific Islander Student Association (PISA), where I contribute to planning board meetings, organizing cultural events, and creating spaces for Pacific Islander students to feel seen and heard on campus. Before coming to UC Riverside, I had the unique opportunity to work as a tour guide at the Polynesian Cultural Center in Hawaii, where I represented the island of Samoa. This experience deepened my connection to my Pacific Islander heritage and strengthened my communication and leadership skills with others. Sharing my culture with visitors from around the world reinforced my appreciation for storytelling and education as powerful tools for bridging gaps between communities. In high school, I served as co-editor-in-chief of the yearbook, where I honed my writing, editing, and design skills. This role not only taught me the importance of collaboration and meeting deadlines but also fueled my love for capturing and sharing peopleâ€™s stories. These experiences continue to shape my approach to public policyâ€”seeing the world through a storytelling lens helps me understand the real impact policies have on individuals and communities. Academically, my interests lie in the relationship between policy and social justice, particularly in areas like economic inequality, education reform, and cultural preservation. I have explored these topics through my coursework, including discussions on political philosophy, public policy analysis, and constitutional law. My studies have allowed me to critically examine how policies shape society and how they can be reformed to promote equity and justice. Looking ahead, I hope to use my degree in Public Policy to work in a space where I can advocate for underrepresented communities, whether thatâ€™s in government, a nonprofit organization, or a policy research institution. I believe in the power of policy to create tangible change, and I am excited to contribute to a more equitable and inclusive society through my work.
